# Blogging website
This is the code of the blogging website made using **Prisma** as ORM for database, **Hono** for routing and middleware, and **Vite-React** for frontend.
The features of this website are:
- User can login and access all the blogs that different users have written
- If there is no account, they can create a new account
- The user can create his own blog for the others to see

This has also been deployed and you can find it on https://blog-app-ten-bice.vercel.app/signin
